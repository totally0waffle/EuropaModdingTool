# EuropaModdingTool
**Incredibly W.I.P modding tool for eu4**
# Current Status
**This is not in a usable state.**
progress is changing rapidly so its hard to keep this section updated.
currently it contains a TUI that lets you generate a .mod with custom tags, versions and name.

There is a pre-included binary in the build folder, but I am nowhere near proud enough yet to create a full blown release.

# OS Support
- [x] Linux/Unix
- [ ] Windows

My main priority is going to be on linux while it is still using a termnial interface. Though it will probably compile on windows I cannot provide support for users that wish to go that route. Once a graphical interface is implemented then I will be focuing on a multi-os support method.

MacOS will not be officially supported by me, however if anyone wishes to implement MacOS specific fixes/patches feel free to fork or submit a bug report in the issue tracker.

# Plans for the future

Eventually I plan on having a full fledged graphical interface however at this point it is far out of my scope. My main goal is to atleast get the current roadmap finished and functional with very basic mod building capabilities. However I do want to implement graphical mission designing and building which I personally would find to be confusing or somewhat difficult within a termnial interface.
