# Development Journal
## come here for any updates on the project, I will try and update this per night of commits

(2025-08-07 @ 1:41pm MST)
Currently the biggest hurdle with this project is finding the time to accomplish all of the things I want to do (cliche being that this journal is the first commit in 3 weeks). On next commit I think it may be of some value to stage actual releases using currently working build binaries.
This probably won't work properly out of its build environment however, on the release notes I will atleast try and bundle the hardware information so that the requirements aren't a complete question mark. Hopefully this week and the next coming I will be able to finish the readme, especially this weekend
I plan on dumping a ton of time into this project with the sole goal of finishing its TUI implementation, I will eventually move this implementation to its own seperate branch once I begin work on the graphical version of the project
